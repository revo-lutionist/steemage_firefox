# steemage_firefox

Create an image portfolio on the fly for any steemit.com or steempeak.com user blog.

This extension is for the Firefox browser

To install, navigate to `about:debugging#addons`, click `Load Temporary Addon`, and select any file in the folder containing the extension.

Once installed, the extension icon will show at the right-side end of the address bar when you visit any steem blog on steemit.com or steempeak.com (eg. https://steemit.com/@revo)

Click on it to extract images from the user's blog (first 50 posts minus resteems), and they will display in a new tab.

The icon won't show, and is inactive, when you are on any other webpage
